4. WHEN a file is deleted during monitoring THEN the system SHALL remove it from tracking

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Format Detection

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the system to automatically detect CSV format characteristics, so that I don't need to manually configure format settings for each data source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a CSV file THEN the system SHALL auto-detect the delimiter (comma, semicolon, pipe, tab)
2. WHEN analyzing file structure THEN the system SHALL identify the presence of header rows
3. WHEN reading files THEN the system SHALL handle various text qualifiers and encoding formats (UTF-8, Latin-1)
4. IF standard detection fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback detection mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Table Name Extraction

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want table names automatically extracted from filenames, so that data is loaded into appropriately named database tables without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a file THEN the system SHALL extract the base name by removing the .csv extension
2. WHEN extracting table names THEN the system SHALL strip date patterns (YYYYMMDD, YYYY-MM-DD)
3. WHEN normalizing names THEN the system SHALL convert special characters to underscores and normalize to lowercase
4. WHEN handling complex patterns THEN the system SHALL produce valid database table names

### Requirement 5: Batch Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want data processed in configurable batches, so that large files don't overwhelm system resources or database connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingesting data THEN the system SHALL process in batches of 990 rows by default
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL support files up to 100MB+ efficiently
3. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL support both fullload (truncate and reload) and append modes
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction to maintain data integrity

### Requirement 6: Progress Tracking and Cancellation

**User Story:** As a data operations manager, I want real-time progress tracking for long-running operations, so that I can monitor processing status and cancel operations if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL report progress by percentage completion
2. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL log progress at configurable intervals
3. WHEN cancellation is requested THEN the system SHALL support operation cancellation
4. WHEN system restarts THEN the system SHALL persist progress state for recovery

### Requirement 7: Database Connection Management

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want robust database connection management, so that the system maintains reliable database connectivity under varying load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to database THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling with configurable pool size
2. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL validate connections before use
4. WHEN handling timeouts THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle connection timeouts

### Requirement 8: File Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a data auditor, I want complete file lifecycle management, so that I can track what happened to every file and access processed or failed files for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing succeeds THEN the system SHALL move files to processed/ subfolder with timestamp prefix
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL move files to error/ subfolder with error information
3. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL preserve original metadata and create folder structure if missing
4. WHEN tracking files THEN the system SHALL record all activities in the tracking database

### Requirement 9: Reference Data Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want automatic configuration management for reference data, so that reference data tables are properly registered in the system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing reference data files THEN the system SHALL insert records into Reference_Data_Cfg table
2. WHEN processing non-reference data files THEN the system SHALL skip configuration record generation
3. WHEN handling duplicates THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate configuration records gracefully
