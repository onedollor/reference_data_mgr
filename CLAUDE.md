# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a reference data manager project that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains:

- A Python virtual environment (`venv/`) with pyodbc installed
- Basic directory structure for a Python-based data management system

## Development Environment

### Python Environment
- Python virtual environment is set up in `venv/`
- pyodbc is installed for database connectivity
- Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Database Connectivity
- The project uses pyodbc for database operations, suggesting integration with SQL Server or other ODBC-compatible databases

## Project Status

This repository is in its initial setup phase. Future development will likely involve:
- Database schema and connection management
- Reference data models and operations
- Data validation and transformation utilities
- API or interface layer for data access

## Notes

- This is a fresh repository with minimal code structure established
- Database connectivity is prepared via pyodbc installation
- Architecture and patterns will emerge as development progresses
