  1. Remove hardcoded credentials from .env and implement proper secrets
  management
  2. Add comprehensive input validation to prevent SQL injection and file path
   traversal
  3. Implement authentication/authorization for API endpoints
  
  1. Security vulnerabilities: Hardcoded credentials, SQL injection risks, no
  authentication
  2. Extremely low test coverage: Only ~15% coverage for a data processing
  system
  3. Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient database operations, no connection
  pooling
